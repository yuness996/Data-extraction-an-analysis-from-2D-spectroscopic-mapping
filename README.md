# Data-extraction-an-analysis-from-2D-spectroscopic-mapping
At LUMEN-PV there is spectroscopic set-up that performs mapping  measurements. For each point in the map, a whole spectrum is  collected. Code an algorithm is done that finds the peak/s in each  spectrum and extracts the information to obtain graphs of  different physical parameters, such as peak position, FWHM, peak  yield, etc.
